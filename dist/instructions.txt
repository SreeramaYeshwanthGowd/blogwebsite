Updates to do:
The search bar should display results matching the keywords, and when a user selects an article, it should open. Filter article options should be a dropdown list. The close button, which appears after opening the article, should be displayed immediately when the user opens the article, not at the end. Streamline article content to be more succinct, using fewer words and more visual-based explanations like 3D graphics, charts, and graphs. Add an index-like structure to make article content navigation easy. Change the website background color to black and add galaxy/space animations to make the user feel like they are scrolling through space/the galaxy.
