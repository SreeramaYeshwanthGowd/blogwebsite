## Technical Details

### Three.js Implementation
The space/galaxy background is implemented using Three.js, a powerful 3D library. The implementation includes:

- A rotating galaxy with thousands of particles
- Background stars with twinkling effect
- Colorful nebula clouds with glow effects
- Parallax effect that responds to mouse movement
- Depth effect that responds to page scrolling
- Optimized rendering for performance

### Chart.js Integration
Interactive charts are implemented using Chart.js with custom styling to match the site theme:

- Radar charts for technology adoption trends
- Custom tooltips with detailed information
- Responsive design that adapts to container size
- Animation effects when charts come into view
- Dark theme with custom colors matching the site palette

### Animation System
The scroll animation system uses a combination of CSS @keyframes and JavaScript:

- IntersectionObserver API for triggering animations when elements enter viewport
- Staggered animations for a more natural feel
- Performance optimizations to prevent layout thrashing
- Fallbacks for browsers that don't support certain features

## Browser Compatibility
The implementation has been tested and works on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

Mobile responsiveness has been ensured for devices of all sizes.

## Future Enhancements
Potential future improvements could include:
- WebGL detection and fallback for devices without 3D support
- Further performance optimizations for the 3D background
- Additional interactive chart types
- Enhanced accessibility features
- Server-side rendering support

## Conclusion
All requirements specified in the instructions.txt file have been successfully implemented. The technical blog now features a modern, immersive design with improved error handling, better user experience, and interactive elements while maintaining performance and accessibility standards.
